/// view that doesn't distract the user with glassing and lensing when they're scrolling or
/// interacting with other onscreen elements, but turns into glass when a user starts interacting
/// with the view.

  /// lensing, and just shows a background view or background color. This is useful when you don't
  /// want to display the lens when a user isn't interacting with it.
